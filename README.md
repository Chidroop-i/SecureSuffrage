Introduction
India is a country with a voting population of about 900 million people. It is the world's largest celebration of democracy. So we at         believe that a good democracy needs a strong foundation laid in integrity, trust, transparency and security.

Motivation
The election process was created to help democracy but it feels like we have been shackled by the very same process, below are the few problems faced :
Cost and manpower required for an election in our country is just enormous.
Accountability and Integrity have always been issues in multiple domains, like :
Transfer and storage of EVMS
Creation and maintenance of voters list
Verification of a voter
Vote counting and manipulation.
The sheer amount of paperwork and manual labor required is unimaginable.
It's time for a revolution and some innovation.Hence we propose a multi part solution that cuts across few of the pain points.

Solution and Workflow
Asset Declaration 
Declaring assets and flow of money through parties has always been a prime concern for the EC, The current system lacks       transparency and integrity. With the help of smart contracts we can track each candidate’s  spending to the last cent.

The system can also act as a Live POC for other government entities to implement blockchain.
Eg The Land Registration can be completely Moved to a Blockchain based system. Saving Crores for the Govt.  
Micro Democracy
Democracy is a system where citizens exercise the power by electing representatives, where in people’s voice needs to be heard from time to time but for a country like ours it is impossible to conduct an election so often. So it’s time to bring back the power to the people. 

<our product> aims to create a platform where we can establish a two-way channel between the citizen and their representatives. Where Major policies or complaints can be raised and the constituency members can vote on it or raise issues.
