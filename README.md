## Introduction

India is a country with a voting population of about 900 million people. It is the world's largest celebration of democracy. So we at         believe that a good democracy needs a strong foundation laid in integrity, trust, transparency and security.

## Motivation
The election process was created to help democracy but it feels like we have been shackled by the very same process, below are the few problems faced :
- Cost and manpower required for an election in our country is just enormous.
- Accountability and Integrity have always been issues in multiple domains, like :
  - Transfer and storage of EVMS
  - Creation and maintenance of voters list
  - Verification of a voter
  - Vote counting and manipulation.
- The sheer amount of paperwork and manual labor required is unimaginable.
It's time for a revolution and some innovation.Hence we propose a multi part solution that cuts across few of the pain points.

## Solution and Workflow
### Direct Voting system
We understand that one of the key issues with the current system is that a voter has to be present at his/her constituency on a particular day. This restriction is one of the primary reasons we have a low voter turn out. 
We plan to address this with a  digital voting system powered by Azure blockchain and other Azure services like cosmos Db, Azure ML services etc.

- On boarding current eligible voters onto our Voterchain, this process will be online at digital centres through the EC where Image data will also be captured.
- crypto currency thingi here, yet to add
- On the day of election, the image data is used through Microsoft Cognitive services and AI to help extend a second layer of verification.
- Once authenticated by a bilayer system, the screen will be custom populated with the respective constituency candidates.
- Voter can choose the candidate irrespective of the location of voting.

### Asset Declaration 
Declaring assets and flow of money through parties has always been a prime concern for the EC, The current system lacks       transparency and integrity. With the help of smart contracts we can track each candidate’s  spending to the last cent.

The system can also act as a Live POC for other government entities to implement blockchain.
Eg The Land Registration can be completely Moved to a Blockchain based system. Saving Crores for the Govt.  
### Micro Democracy
Democracy is a system where citizens exercise the power by electing representatives, where in people’s voice needs to be heard from time to time but for a country like ours it is impossible to conduct an election so often. So it’s time to bring back the power to the people. 

<our product> aims to create a platform where we can establish a two-way channel between the citizen and their representatives. Where Major policies or complaints can be raised and the constituency members can vote on it or raise issues.
